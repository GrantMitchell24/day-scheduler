Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

This is an event planner with the current date at the top. This allows you to see what time you are currently on, past, and future times by color coordination. You can also save the information to local storage. 

I spent quite a bit of time trying to get the infromation to save when I reload the page, but was unsuccessful. I will spend more time on this going forward to correct, just didn't have any more time to figure it out this evening.
